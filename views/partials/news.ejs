	<p>I love what Elizabeth does for my skin, in office and what she teaches me for home care. I'm addicted to my Clarisonic - won't go a day without it. My skin has never looked better in my entire life. Since moving to SF two years ago, and being diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer at that same time, my skin glows and despite two years of chemo and treatments. I've never had more compliments about my skin.</p>
